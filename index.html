    <!-- 3. Head vs Body -->
    <!-- The <head> contains meta information about the document (not shown on the page), like <title>, <meta>, <link>, etc.

    <h1>This is an H1 heading</h1>
    <h2>This is an H2 heading</h2>
    <h3>This is an H3 heading</h3>
    <h4>This is an H4 heading</h4>
    <h5>This is an H5 heading</h5>
    <h6>This is an H6 heading</h6>

    <!-- 6. Line breaks -->
